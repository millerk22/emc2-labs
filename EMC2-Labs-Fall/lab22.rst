Lab 22: The Lean Theorem Prover Part I
======================================

From the Lean Theorem Prover community website:
   A proof assistant is a piece of software that provides a language for defining objects, specifying properties of these objects, and proving that these specifications hold. The system checks that these proofs are correct down to their logical foundation.

   These tools are often used to verify the correctness of programs. But they can also be used for abstract mathematics.... In a formalization, all definitions are precisely specified and all proofs are virtually guaranteed to be correct.

In this lab, we will get a sense of how a theorem prover works by proving basic properties of the natural numbers in the interactive theorem prover Lean.
