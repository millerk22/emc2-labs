Lab 4: Introduction to Space Curves
===================================

All materials for this lab are in a Colab notebook: `<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lCoAwpZyQ8GPDE7a2CqdbbXWCk6WLmvC?usp=sharing>`_

Note: this lab has animations, and getting all the appropriate packages installed on your own computer can be really finicky.  Even if you prefer to do things on your own machine, please use the Google Colab notebook this week.
