# emc2-labs

Source repository for the BYU EMC2 labs.

## RST and Sphinx

The labs are written in reStructuredText (RST or reST) and compiled using Sphinx.
Check out the [RST primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#rst-primer) and a [guide for doing math](https://sphinx-rtd-trial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/math.html) in RST.
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html) is a Python library for converting RST files into HTML files (webpages).

### Environment Configuration

The file [`config/environment.yml`](./config/deployment.svg) contains the [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) environment configuration used when compiling the labs.
Create the environment from scratch:
>>>>>>> f7dbf71 (slightly clean conf files, add some startup details to README)

```bash
conda deactivate
conda env create -f config/environment.yml
conda activate emc2_dev
```

Or, update an existing environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
conda env update -n emc2_dev -f config/environment.yml
conda activate emc2_dev
```

### Compiling the Labs Locally

The fall and winter labs are stored in separate folders, each of which has a `Makefile` with the sphinx compilation recipes.

```bash
cd EMC2-Labs-Fall
make html
open _build/html/index.html  # Open the compiled labs in a browser.
```

## Deploying Compiled Code to emc2.byu.edu

In order for the labs to show up on the EMC2 website, we need to compile the labs to HTML and move them to the right server.
First, create a file named `server_config.env` in the directory `emc2_labs/config`. It should contain the following::

```txt
EMC2_USER=<username>
EMC2_PATH=<path_to_emc2_labs>
MATH_PATH=<path_to_emc2_labs>
```

Here, everything in `<>` should be replaced with the actual values (get these from the current leader of the project). Note that the `EMC2_PATH` and the `MATH_PATH` are different.

Run `initiate_deploy.sh` with the options -f, -w, or -a (for fall, winter, or all)

If this doesn't work, `initiate_deploy.sh` may not have permission to execute. You can fix this with

```bash
chmod +x initiate_deploy.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> `config/build_and_deploy.sh` should never be run from your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> The SSH protocol requires three things, the username, hostname, and password. The username and hostname are usually paired together like `<username>@<hostname>`. When this script asks for the username, only put in the actual `username` and not the username-hostname pair.

### Behind the Scenes

Running [`initiate_deploy.sh`](./initiate_deploy.sh) accesses the emc2 server (and make sure you have an ssh key to get in) and calls `config/build_and_deploy.sh`, which pulls everything, compiles the labs, then copies all the resulting HTML files to [emc2.byu.edu](https://emc2.byu.edu/).

## Future Features

If you are feeling really ambitious, Codebuddy can be hard to work with---especially when trying to align tasks in the `.rst` files and the ones written in Codebuddy. Codebuddy *does* have a feature where you can import/export assignments ("Import Assignment" button in the course homepage or "Export Assignment" in the assignment page) as `json` files. This means that you *could* write a program that would go through all the `.rst` files and extract out all the task instructions, and then save them to a `json` file that could be imported to Codebuddy.

Here are a few thoughts on this idea:

- If the program could handle some of the other features of Codebuddy like hints, solutions, verification code, and tests, that would be great.
  - The last three of those examples would obviously not be written in the ``rst`` files, but maybe a separate file in a separate folder that sphinx doesn't touch?
- Codebuddy can't handle $\text{LaTeX}$, but many of our tasks use $\text{LaTeX}$ in the description, perhaps a tool that could strip this out, or replace it with Markdown inline code would be nice.
  - Codebuddy also uses Markdown which is slightly different than `rst` syntax (see how bulleted lists are made in both), so handling that would be great as well.
  - The same issue occurs with code blocks in Markdown and `rst`
- Integrating this program into our `make` file would enable these `json` files to be updated every time we deployed or used `make` locally, but (as of right now) I think we would still have to import the `json` file by hand.
- having an option to `[include_previous]` (see Codebuddy task instruction for more info) would be a great feature.

This would be a lot of work and I don't know if the amount of work would be worth it. We may not even be using Codebuddy in the future. It is also possible Codebuddy improves and gets an API for importing and exporting assignments (which may make this project worthwhile).
