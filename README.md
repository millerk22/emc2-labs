### Notes on RST and Sphinx 

Check out the rst primer [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#rst-primer). Also check out the [following for doing math](https://sphinx-rtd-trial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/math.html) in rst.

To compile sphinx code, check out their [main build page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html). Mainly comes down to the following:

`sphinx-build -M html sourcedir outputdir`
